# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Problem Statement
A telecom company is facing a challenge with customers churning, which impacts its revenue and growth. The company collects data from its on-premises systems and stores it in Azure Blob Storage. The goal is to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn so that retention strategies can be implemented.

## Solution
This project implements a machine learning model to predict customer churn for the telecom company. It utilizes Azure cloud services for data storage, model training, and deployment, ensuring scalability and efficient workflow management.

## Architecture
1. **Data Source**: Telecom application database (on-premises) â†’ Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Data Processing**: Data is preprocessed and prepared for model training.
3. **Model Training**: Performed using Azure Machine Learning Studio, leveraging automated machine learning and custom ML pipelines.
4. **Model Deployment**: The model is deployed to an Azure ML Endpoint for real-time predictions.

    ```

## Implementation Process
The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data is loaded from Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, transformed, and split into training and testing datasets.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Key features that affect customer churn are identified and processed.
4. **Model Training**: The predictive model is trained using Azure Machine Learning Studio's AutoML or custom ML pipelines.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on test data to measure accuracy and performance.
6. **Deployment**: The model is deployed as an Azure ML Endpoint for real-time prediction.

All steps are documented in detail within the project files.

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 0.81
- **Precision**: High precision in identifying likely churners, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Deployment
The model is deployed as an Azure ML Endpoint, accessible via a REST API. Refer to the deployment documentation for detailed steps on how to deploy and interact with the model.
